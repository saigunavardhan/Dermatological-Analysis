Computer Vision for Dermatological Analysis

Current project in the works, where we aim to use computer vision to categorize skin cancer, and on being provided with images spread apart by time, will identify the spread of the skin condition and the rate of the spread. Implementing this model for melanoma.

We have aimed to categorize the severity of the condition based on a multi criteria decision block, using multiple parameters such as pigmentation, area, and category. For the multi label classification, we have experimented with Convolutional Neural Networks and EfficientNet, before moving on to Involution and applying the previous models using involution.
Dataset used for the execution of the models was obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign/">Kaggle</a>..
